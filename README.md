# Reinforcement Learning-based Resource Management xApp for O-RAN

Welcome to the repository for my xApp developed for resource management in communication networks using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. This xApp is part of the research published in the paper titled ["Actor-Critic Network for O-RAN Resource Allocation: xApp Design, Deployment, and Analysis"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10008713).

## üìú Overview

This xApp implements a resource management solution for O-RAN using an A2C Actor-Critic RL model. The model is designed to optimize the allocation of resources in a communication network by learning from the environment and making decisions that maximize efficiency and performance. 

## What is an xApp?

An xApp is a containerized microservice designed to perform specific network functions, such as resource management or optimization, within a distributed network environment. xApps are typically deployed on Kubernetes clusters, running as pods within the nodes of the cluster. Each xApp operates independently, interacting with other network elements through well-defined APIs. The containerized nature of xApps allows for scalability, flexibility, and ease of deployment, enabling them to be seamlessly integrated into existing network infrastructures. These applications are highly modular and can be updated or scaled without impacting the rest of the system, making them ideal for dynamic network environments where real-time adjustments are critical for maintaining performance and efficiency.


### Key Features:
- **Reinforcement Learning Model:** Utilizes the A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) architecture to learn and optimize resource allocation strategies in real-time.
- **O-RAN Integration:** Designed specifically for O-RAN networks, allowing seamless integration and deployment.
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling high-dimensional state spaces and large action spaces, making it suitable for complex network environments.
- **Real-Time Decision Making:** The xApp makes resource allocation decisions every second, ensuring timely and efficient management of network resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

- `mr/`: Contains the main logic of the xApp, including the RL model and environment setup.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the xApp, where the environment is initialized, and the RL loop is executed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Gym
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if applicable)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrkouchaki/mr10.git
    cd mr10/mr
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the xApp:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üß† Model Architecture

The xApp utilizes an Actor-Critic architecture, a combination of policy-based and value-based methods. This allows the model to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, leading to better resource allocation decisions.

### Components:
- **Actor Network:** Determines the best action to take based on the current state.
- **Critic Network:** Evaluates the action taken by the actor and provides feedback to improve future decisions.
